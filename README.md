# 2-Minute-Movie-using-AI


I am looking for a creative individual to produce a 2-minute movie using AI technology that encapsulates my vision. This project requires a deep understanding of AI tools for video creation and a knack for storytelling through visuals. The ideal candidate should be able to translate abstract concepts into engaging visual narratives. If you are experienced in AI-driven video production and passionate about bringing ideas to life, I would love to hear from you!
----------
To produce a 2-minute movie using AI technology, you can leverage tools like OpenAI's GPT-3 (for generating the script), DeepAI, Runway ML, or D-ID (for creating AI-generated visuals), and Pexels or Unsplash API (for sourcing high-quality royalty-free images and videos). You can also consider Synthesia or Pictory for AI-powered video creation. Here's a Python code outline that integrates these tools to produce a movie with AI-driven video creation:
High-Level Steps:

    Generate Script: Use GPT-3 or GPT-4 to generate a script for the 2-minute movie.
    Generate Visuals: Use tools like Runway ML (for AI-generated visuals) or D-ID (for generating faces and avatars).
    Create Video: Use libraries like moviepy or an AI platform (like Synthesia) to create the video.
    Edit Video: Use moviepy to piece everything together into a movie.

Required Libraries:

pip install openai moviepy requests pillow pexelsapi

Step 1: Generate Script using GPT-3

The first step is to create the script for the video. GPT-3 can be used to generate text based on prompts you provide.

import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def generate_script(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500,  # Generate a script of appropriate length for a 2-minute video
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example of how you can create a prompt
prompt = "Generate a 2-minute script for a motivational video about overcoming challenges. Make the narrative emotional and uplifting."
script = generate_script(prompt)

print("Generated Script: \n", script)

Step 2: Generate Visual Content using AI Tools

Now, let’s generate visuals using an AI tool. For this example, we’ll use Pexels API to get free stock images and videos, but you can use more advanced AI tools for generating realistic visuals (e.g., Runway ML for AI-generated content).

You can replace Pexels API with AI-based image/video generation if you have access to such tools.

import requests
from pexelsapi import API

# Pexels API key
pexels_api_key = 'your-pexels-api-key'
api = API(pexels_api_key)

def fetch_images(query, num_images=5):
    api.search(query, page=1, results_per_page=num_images)
    return api.get_entries()

# Fetch motivational images or scenes related to overcoming challenges
images = fetch_images('motivation, overcoming challenges')

# Download images from Pexels API
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    image_url = image['src']['original']
    img_data = requests.get(image_url).content
    with open(f'image_{i}.jpg', 'wb') as img_file:
        img_file.write(img_data)

    print(f"Image {i} downloaded.")

Step 3: Create Video using moviepy

You can now combine the images, script, and voiceover into a video using moviepy.

from moviepy.editor import *
from gtts import gTTS

# Create voiceover from script using Google Text-to-Speech
def create_voiceover(script):
    tts = gTTS(script, lang='en')
    tts.save("voiceover.mp3")

# Create the video with images
def create_video(images, voiceover_path):
    clips = []

    # Load images as clips
    for img_path in images:
        img_clip = ImageClip(img_path, duration=5)  # Each image will be shown for 5 seconds
        img_clip = img_clip.set_fps(24)  # Set frame rate for the video
        clips.append(img_clip)

    # Concatenate all the clips into one
    video = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")

    # Add the voiceover to the video
    voiceover = AudioFileClip(voiceover_path)
    video = video.set_audio(voiceover)

    # Final output video
    video.write_videofile("final_video.mp4", codec="libx264", fps=24)

# Generate the voiceover
create_voiceover(script)

# List of images you downloaded
images = ['image_0.jpg', 'image_1.jpg', 'image_2.jpg', 'image_3.jpg', 'image_4.jpg']

# Create the video
create_video(images, "voiceover.mp3")

Step 4: Finalizing and Enhancing

    Text Overlay: You can add text overlays to the video to display the script or key points.
    Background Music: Add background music to enhance the atmosphere of the video.
    Transitions: Use smooth transitions between video clips or images for a more cinematic feel.

Here’s an additional code snippet to add text overlays on top of the images:

def add_text_overlay(image_path, text):
    img_clip = ImageClip(image_path, duration=5)
    txt_clip = TextClip(text, fontsize=50, color='white', bg_color='black', size=img_clip.size)
    txt_clip = txt_clip.set_position('center').set_duration(5)
    video_clip = CompositeVideoClip([img_clip, txt_clip])
    return video_clip

# Add text overlay on each image clip
video_clips = []
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    text = script.split('.')[i]  # Split script into sentences for each image
    video_clip = add_text_overlay(image, text)
    video_clips.append(video_clip)

# Combine all clips
final_video = concatenate_videoclips(video_clips)
final_video.write_videofile("enhanced_final_video.mp4", codec="libx264", fps=24)

Step 5: Upload the Video

Once the video is generated, you can upload it to various platforms using APIs or manual upload depending on where you want to showcase your movie.
Final Remarks:

    The above code serves as a basic framework. You can integrate more advanced AI tools such as Runway ML for AI-generated visuals, Synthesia for deepfake avatars, and more sophisticated video-editing effects for a professional result.
    If you're working with more advanced video production tools, you could integrate DeepAI or Runway ML APIs for generating dynamic video content based on the script.
    This process requires creative thinking and testing to bring the abstract ideas to life with AI.
